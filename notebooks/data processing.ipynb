    "\"* indicates cell has been suppressed, a blank cell indicates no report has been received for a given district in the indicated time period, a 0 indicates that a report was received and no cases were reported for that group in the reported time period. Single-campus student cases and sources of infection are suppressed when (1) reported student cases are fewer than 5, (2) a campus has at least a 90% student positivity rate when on-campus enrollment for a school is at least 15 students, or (3) a campus has at least a 50% positivity rate when on-campus enrollment has fewer than 15 students. If only one campus in a district has suppressed student numbers then student and source of infection numbers for the campus with the next smallest numbers of positive students are also suppressed. Cumulative student cases and sources of infection numbers for a campus are suppressed when (1) student cases are less than five, or (2) current report numbers have been suppressed for the first three weeks that student cases are reported. If there is only one campus reporting in a district and it is a multiple campus, student and source of infection numbers are not suppressed for the district total. Otherwise, district totals are suppressed when (1) student cases are fewer than 5, or (2) a district has at least a 90% student positivity rate when total district enrollment is least 15 students, or, (3) a district has at least a 50% positivity rate when total district enrollment has fewer than 15 students, or (4) cases on a campus have been suppressed for the first three weeks that student cases are reported and there are fewer than 5 campuses reporting in a district.\""
